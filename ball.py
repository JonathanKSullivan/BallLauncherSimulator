"""
This module defines the Ball class used in physics simulations, specifically
designed to simulate the dynamics of a ball in environments influenced by
factors like drag and gravity. The Ball class incorporates realistic physics
behaviors including mass-based motion, air resistance, and external forces to
provide a detailed simulation suitable for educational, gaming, or scientific
applications.

The Ball class supports various operations such as launching, resetting,
updating based on physical laws, and rendering its state in a Pygame window.
It utilizes numpy for numerical operations and Pygame for visualization,
making it a versatile tool for demonstrating concepts in physics and 
engineering.

        defining its size, mass, drag characteristics, and initial motion
        state.

        Parameters:
            position (list or np.ndarray): The initial position of the ball,
                specified as a two-element list or array
                representing the x and y coordinates. This position should be
                in simulation-specific units that relate to the real-world
                scale via the scale_factor.
            ball_size (float): The diameter of the ball in meters. This value
                is used to calculate the ball's radius and, subsequently, its
                volume and mass assuming a spherical shape and uniform density.
            scale_factor (float): A coefficient used to scale physical
                dimensions within the simulation environment. For instance,
                this factor can be used to convert real-world measurements
                (like meters) to simulation units (like pixels).
            drag_coefficient (float, optional): The coefficient of drag for
                the ball, which affects how air resistance influences its
                motion. This is a unitless coefficient typically ranging from
                0 (no drag) to 1 (high drag), with a default of 0.47
                appropriate for a sphere in a fluid like air.
            cross_sectional_area (float, optional): The cross-sectional area
            of the ball in square meters, used in drag force calculations. It
            is essential for determining how much air resistance the ball
            encounters, with a default of 0.001 square meters typically

        Notes:
            The mass of the ball is calculated based on the volume derived
            from the ball_size and assuming a density typical of steel
